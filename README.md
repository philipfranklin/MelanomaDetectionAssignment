# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A model which can alert dermatologist if the image is detected as melanoma.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

## Conclusions
- Model is slightly over fitting.
- The accuracy is enhanced by the class imbalance treatment and by applying augmentation strategy.
- Model can be further be enhanced by adding more layers, neurons and hyperparameter tuning.


## Technologies Used
- tensorflow 2.14.0
- NumPy 1.19.2
- Pandas 2.1.1
